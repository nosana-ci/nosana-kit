# Job Definition

The job definition is the heart of your jobs. It tells the Nosana nodes what to run, how to run it, and what it needs.

A job definition is a JSON document that specifies the container images, commands, environment variables, and resource requirements needed to execute your tasks on the network. When you post a job using the CLI or SDK, you provide a job definition that describes exactly how your workload should run.
