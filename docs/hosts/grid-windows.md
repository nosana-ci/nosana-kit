# Setup for Windows


::: warning Platform Support
As of this release, Windows (including WSL2) is being deprecated as a supported platform for Nosana GPU Hosts. Going forward, only native Linux installations are officially supported. We recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 or newer for the best experience and compatibility with the Nosana Node software.
