# Examples Catalog

Explore a collection of ready-to-use examples for running jobs on the Nosana Network. These examples demonstrate various use cases, from simple commands to complex AI inference workloads.

Nosana is a fully permissionless network, which means you can run whatever model or workload you want! You can also find more examples and templates on [Nosana Templates](https://github.com/nosana-ci/pipeline-templates/tree/main/templates) on GitHub.

## Getting Started Examples

### [Hello World](/inference/examples/hello_world)
A simple example demonstrating how to run a basic shell command in an Ubuntu container. Perfect for understanding the fundamentals of Nosana job definitions.

### [Multi Job](/inference/examples/multi_job)
Learn how to run multiple jobs in parallel, coordinating multiple containers to work together.

## AI Inference Examples

### [Jupyter](/inference/examples/jupyter)
Run Jupyter Notebooks with GPU support and access them via a web interface. Perfect for data science experiments and research.

### [Ollama](/inference/examples/ollama)
Get up and running with Llama 3.1, Mistral, Gemma 2, and other large language models. Communicate with your models via an API endpoint.

### [vLLM](/inference/examples/vllm)
Create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint using the VLLM engine with cached resources on the Nosana network.

### [TinyLlama](/inference/examples/tinyllama)
Run the TinyLlama language model for fast inference workloads.

### [LMDeploy](/inference/examples/lmdeploy)
Deploy language models using LMDeploy for efficient inference.

## Image Generation

### [Stable Diffusion WebUI](/inference/examples/stable)
Run Stable Diffusion WebUI to generate stunning images using advanced AI. Access a full web interface for image creation.

## Audio Processing

### [Whisper](/inference/examples/whisper)
Run OpenAI's Whisper model for speech recognition and transcription tasks.

## Web Interfaces

### [Open WebUI](/inference/examples/open_webui)
Deploy Open WebUI to interact with language models through a user-friendly web interface.
